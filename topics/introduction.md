# Manual Base Functionality
This manual describes how to set up and use the Base Functionality app.

## Introduction

### Extension to the basic Business Central package
Do you often receive incoming invoices or send invoices related to the next/previous month or quarter? Then, you can use a postponement code with the extension of the basic package. Using a postponement code ensures that your costs and income are automatically split and booked in the period you want them to be. In addition, a standard layout is developed for various documentation. As a result, you give every form or document the same look and feel, and your company radiates professionalism.

### What is Base Functionality?
_Deferral code_

Do you want to understand your company's costs and revenues better? Then, it's nice to spread the costs to the correct month or quarter. To apply the charges of an invoice over different periods, you can use the deferral code. A deferral code can help book costs paid annually, but you want to spread over multiple periods to which these costs relate. Consider, for example, charges for insurance or subscriptions. The standard functionality does not support this solution. With the Base Functionality app, you can add this functionality to your Business Central environment and ensure a better understanding of your finances.
Without Base Functionality, you will only be able to use deferral codes within sales- and purchase invoices. 
Base Functionality will also give you the possibility to use deferral codes on contracts and projects.

_Standard invoice and document layout_

Of course, you want your outgoing documents to look neat. Your customers will get their hands on this documentation, which is why it's a vital calling card for your business. In conclusion, investing in well-designed invoice and document layouts can positively impact efficiency, customer relationships, and your business's overall look and feel.

In the standard application of Business Central, the layouts are not standardized. With this app, you can give the following documents all the same look and feel
*	Project Quotation;
*	Purchase Quotation
*	Purchase Order
*	Reminder (test)
*	Sales Quotation
*	Sales Order Confirmation
*	Draft Invoice
*	Sales Pro Forma Invoice
*	Sales Invoice
*	Sales Credit Memo
